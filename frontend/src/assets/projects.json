            "info_long": "This project involved collaboration with a neurostimulation company that develops devices to alleviate symptoms from conditions such as depression, cardiac fibrillation, and epilepsy by utilizing vagus nerve stimulation. Our objective was to develop a mechanism for measuring heart rate variability at the auricular region during simultaneous usage of the company’s tVNS device. The collaborator supplied the first model of a tVNS device for comparison and compatibility with our “prototype” heart rate variability sensor. We performed research to identify a cost effective heart rate sensor and an accurate gold standard device for data verification, and developed Arduino code implementing the RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences) algorithm for real time heart rate variability calculations.\n The next steps involved verifying the accuracy of our device and algorithm prototype in controlled trials. We performed data collection and analysis using different anatomical locations for extracting heart rate signals (in beats per minute), evaluating multiple methods for securely fitting the prototype. Additionally, we checked for interference between our prototype and the collaborator’s device. \n Finally, we rigorously verified our prototype through analysis of post-processing outlier data and analysis of other potential sources of measurement errors. We concluded that the collaborator’s device did not interfere with the accuracy of our prototype. Since photoplethysmography (PPG) measurement requires tight contact, further work will be necessary to design a flexible and possibly customizable housing for the prototype that fits snugly against the curvature of the concha in a variety of subjects. Due to logistical complications of COVID-19, later stages of testing were canceled and we advise that our prototype should be further verified with a medical-grade EKG sensor before being adapted and applied in a consumer medical device.  After final verification and integration, the prototype can be utilized to track HRV in conjunction with the collaborator’s device.",

Both designs are 3D-printable and minimize the need for additional material, thus creating cost-effective and efficient solutions.\n The Assistive Sock Aid device, which helps a patient who cannot bend their spine to place a sock on their foot, went through many iterations of design beginning with a prototype made out of a plastic water bottle. Testing was able to occur on the second iteration design which was 3D printed and the results surfaced the need for the device to be thinner, have a mechanism to hold the sock in a more secure manner and have lips that could be threaded. Ultimately, the most optimal design was composed of a tapered semi-cylindrical tube with a lip at the top that allowed for the threading of twine, a hook on the back of the device to hold the sock and holes for the final tying of twine. \n The Arm Supinator/Pronator device, which helps nurse and strengthen a patients injured shoulder through repeated motion of pronation and supination, began with an initial design of a wheel with a center handle that could be used to twist the wheel back and forward. Although testing of the second iteration was supposed to occur with a 3D-printed prototype due to COVID-19 that was not possible. As a result, finite element analysis (FEA) on Fusion 360 was used to determine structural weak points in the design. In the end, the most optimal design attempted to fix these weak points and was composed of a wheel that could attach to the wall through a mount, had a handle in the middle with holes for grip strength and had weights that could be added for increased resistance during use.",

The Incinerator. design is a solution developed for Barefoot College in order to meet the needs of women in Rajasthan, India. Three solutions were first proposed in order to create a clean-energy and low cost menstrual waste disposal system. The activated charcoal filter design focused on filtering out harmful toxins in the smoke produced while burning menstrual waste by adding the activated charcoal filter to a pre-existing mudka. The fresnel lens design aimed to incinerate the menstrual pads by using a fresnel lens which concentrated sunlight onto the pads in order to begin combustion. Lastly, the solar cooker design looked at once again harnessing the power of sunlight in order to then incinerate the pads.\n This design was not prototyped or tested due to time constraints and feasibility. After prototyping the activated charcoal design and testing it with the Wynd Air Quality Tracker it was found that the design did not seem effective in reducing the amount of toxins being produced by the mudka. However, after testing the fresnel lens design in Florida it was found that this design allowed for simple combustion by having the fresnel lens effectively concentrate sunlight to an area and begin combustion around the same time each day. Ultimately, the fresnel lens design was deemed the most successful and optimal design created.",

It also includes medication controls to easily organize medications by keeping track of them, customizing push notifications as reminders, and calendar views to access progress. Lastly, it features a user-focused interface not requiring account registration and using simple visualizations and controls. \n Our simple-to-use application encourages patients to be more proactive in logging their conditions, and enables doctors to easily access their progress.

NIH requested that we build a device that could take information on the force of a patient's grip over time for use in collecting data. We built a small, hollow, hand-held cylinder with three force-sensitive resistors connected to an internal arduino that could track the average force applied to the device based on a set of voltage dividers. This data was transmitted via bluetooth to an external computer. We used an Arduino script on the Adafruit Feather board and a python script for the receiving computer where we saved the data in a CSV. \n Our initial prototype ran on a small internal battery, however when we tested it this semester, we realized the battery ran out of power within about ten minutes, which wasn’t practical for lab use. We eliminated the battery, making it power off a USB connection to a computer instead, allowing for prolonged use. \n An additional capability to our final iteration was serial output via USB, which was integrated in the existing python script. This feature ensured that data could be transmitted in the case that the computers used didn’t have bluetooth capability. The serial output transmits the average of the force-sensitive resistor values over time, the same data as is transmitted by the bluetooth. ",

The device consisted of a frame modeled after a pair of normal eyeglasses, with a small camera attached and pointed at the eye.

We achieved this by using computer vision techniques to process the camera output, identifying key parts of the eye and analyzing changes. To further improve accuracy, we added a UV filter to the camera lens. \n In multiple iterations, we made various tweaks in the mechanical structure and software implementation, including rebuilding with a new camera, improving eye lighting, and adding a python script so that data could be exported in csv format.
