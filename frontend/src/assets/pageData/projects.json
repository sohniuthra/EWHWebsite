            "info_long": "Worldwide, over 15 million infants are born preterm. A current challenge that the neonatal healthcare community faces today is pain management for preterm infants in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU). It is well established that early exposure to pain in preterm infants is associated with negative effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, in lower- and middle-income countries, there is a distinct shortage of pain medication available. One common pain management method is the Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) technique, which involves holding an infant in an upright position on the infant caretaker’s bare chest for long periods of time. However, the KMC technique is not suitable for use because caretakers are unable to use it during pain-inducing procedures. \n To address this challenge, researchers at the University of British Columbia under the leadership of Dr. Liisa Holsti developed the Calmer device, a complex medical instrument that simulates Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) to manage premature infants’ pain in the NICU. Clinical trials have found that the Calmer device provides the same level of pain management for premature infants as human contact using the KMC technique by replicating a heartbeat sound, using a heated and textured surface, and mimicking a breathing motion. Clinical trials have found that the Calmer device provides the same level of pain management for premature infants as another human touch strategy called facilitated tucking by replicating a heartbeat sound, using a skin-like surface, and mimicking a breathing motion. \n The current Calmer device is too expensive and energy-demanding for effective utilization in low and middle-income countries. Furthermore, the current Calmer device isn’t designed for dust protection and easy transport. Thus, our Integrative Design and Electrical subteams worked with Dr. Holsti to redesign the Calmer device for usage in these countries. \n Our device simulates a breathing motion by lifting an acrylic platform up to 0.5” with a camshaft. Metal rods that are affixed to the mobile platform assure that the platform ascends and descends smoothly. This design also incorporates additional features meant to increase the stability of the prototype and breathing motion. These include multiple PLA supports in the middle and the corners of the device to support the platforms, PLA camshaft supports with ball bearings to prevent the camshaft from bending, and a fixed acrylic platform between the moving platform and supports. The camshaft in our device is powered by a motor utilizing an external power source. The device also contains a speaker that plays the sound of a heartbeat, which can be adjusted for speed and volume by using dials. This component is also electronically powered.",

Our objective was to develop a mechanism for measuring heart rate variability at the auricular region during simultaneous usage of the company’s tVNS device. The collaborator supplied the first model of a tVNS device for comparison and compatibility with our “prototype” heart rate variability sensor. We performed research to identify a cost-effective heart rate sensor and an accurate gold standard device for data verification, and developed Arduino code implementing the RMSSD (root mean square of successive differences) algorithm for real-time heart rate variability calculations.\n The next steps involved verifying the accuracy of our device and algorithm prototype in controlled trials. We performed data collection and analysis using different anatomical locations for extracting heart rate signals (in beats per minute), evaluating multiple methods for securely fitting the prototype. Additionally, we checked for interference between our prototype and the collaborator’s device. \n Finally, we rigorously verified our prototype through analysis of post-processing outlier data and analysis of other potential sources of measurement errors. We concluded that the collaborator’s device did not interfere with the accuracy of our prototype. Since photoplethysmography (PPG) measurement requires tight contact, further work will be necessary to design a flexible and possibly customizable housing for the prototype that fits snugly against the curvature of the concha in a variety of subjects. Due to logistical complications of COVID-19, later stages of testing were canceled and we advise that our prototype should be further verified with a medical-grade EKG sensor before being adapted and applied to a consumer medical device.  After final verification and integration, the prototype can be utilized to track HRV in conjunction with the collaborator’s device.",

Both designs are 3D-printable and minimize the need for additional material, thus creating cost-effective and efficient solutions.\n The Assistive Sock Aid device, which helps a patient who cannot bend their spine to place a sock on their foot, went through many iterations of design beginning with a prototype made out of a plastic water bottle. Testing was able to occur on the second iteration design which was 3D printed and the results surfaced the need for the device to be thinner, have a mechanism to hold the sock in a more secure manner, and have lips that could be threaded. Ultimately, the most optimal design was composed of a tapered semi-cylindrical tube with a lip at the top that allowed for the threading of twine, a hook on the back of the device to hold the sock, and holes for the final tying of twine. \n The Arm Supinator/Pronator device, which helps nurse and strengthen a patient's injured shoulder through the repeated motion of pronation and supination, began with an initial design of a wheel with a center handle that could be used to twist the wheel back and forward. Although testing of the second iteration was supposed to occur with a 3D-printed prototype due to COVID-19 that was not possible. As a result, finite element analysis (FEA) on Fusion 360 was used to determine structural weak points in the design. In the end, the most optimal design attempted to fix these weak points and was composed of a wheel that could attach to the wall through a mount, had a handle in the middle with holes for grip strength, and had weights that could be added for increased resistance during use.",

This project was in collaboration with SAWA for Development & Aid, a Civil Society Organization. SAWA works directly to support the needs of refugees in Syria and Lebanon. Specifically, SAWA has created programs that target relief for refugees by providing shelter, energy, food, healthcare, and education. Concern regarding the way refugees were keeping warm in the camps—by burning tires, plastic, trash, etc in plastic barrels releasing toxins into the air and subsequently, living in and breathing those toxins in—prompted the need for a more efficient and non-toxic heating mechanism. \n The proposed heating system involves a solar collector powered by a battery that is charged by a PV cell. A solar charge controller regulates the charging and discharging of the battery and regulates delivery to the load. The heat generated by the solar collector is carried in the water-based mixture through a series of pipes to the kotatsu table. The heated water mixture is circulated into a cylindrical container filled with sand, held above a mesh through which the water, but not the sand, would flow through. The water is then funneled into piping that leads back to the solar collector, thus creating a closed system for the water-based mixture. The reasoning behind this sand-filled container was as follows: hot water would heat the sand and this heat would radiate through the metal cylindrical container and warm the area under the table. This area is closed off from the outside by a large duvet held down by the tabletop. \n Testing for the device took place at Cornell University. The data collected from the testing period gauged the prototype’s success—this was determined from the longevity of the system being able to generate heat, temperature increase in the underside of the table, etc. Designs were passed to the collaborators upon completion.",

            "info_long": "Approximately 50 percent of term newborns and 80 percent of preterm newborns develop jaundice, yellow discoloration of a baby's skin and eyes. Approximately 5 to 10 percent of infant mortality in developing countries is caused by jaundice complications. Jaundice is caused by elevated levels of bilirubin, and 6 million babies a year are at risk for cerebral palsy, blindness, deafness, cognitive damage, and death if left untreated. The cure for jaundice is phototherapy or blue light. However, current solutions, including traditional halogen lamps and modern LED devices, are often not portable and place multiple babies in one device, which  increases the risks of spreading infection and inconsistent treatment.\n The final design by Cornell EWH drew inspiration from collapsible tents and foldable foam boxes and prioritized portability, longevity, electronic embeddability, low cost, ease of use, and feasibility. After consulting with Dr. Srisatish Devapatla at Cayuga Medical Center, the team finalized a lightweight, foldable design with a 180 degree roll top. The device was embedded with blue LED lights in the top struts and bottom cushion and made of waterproof fabric and bean bags. Preliminary performance was collected by the team on the device’s effectiveness.",

Due to their immunosuppressive, carcinogenic, and toxic effects, mycotoxins pose a serious threat to human health across the globe. The populations most susceptible to mycotoxin exposure are those living in rural, resource-limited areas, where subsistence farming is common and food insecurity is a pressing issue.\n Cornell Engineering World Health developed a low-cost, effective solution that small-holder farmers can use to sort their crops and provide safe, healthy food for themselves and their communities. This device was a small-scale gravity table constructed with low-cost, durable, and accessible materials. The table was predominantly made of wood, with a mesh deck, a fan to provide airflow, and a vibrating motor. It was designed to be largely portable, with multiple detachable parts that enabled easy transport. The gravity table sorted out mycotoxin-infected corn kernels from healthy kernels on the basis of density differences. Infected kernels are less dense and thus when fed onto a dual-angled vibrating mesh deck, the fan levitates the contaminated kernels into a separate bin from the healthy ones. This device serves as a low resource option for sorting toxins in corn.",

Current water wells built by nonprofits are dangerous to use because they are not monitored and evaluated for water cleanliness. EWH’s automated water monitor measures basic characteristics of well water and sends information over long distances. The monitor is either solar, battery, or pump powered. \n The main components of the device include a collection chamber and an adjacent analysis chamber. The collection chamber siphons a small portion of the water from the well. In the collection chamber, sensors measure aspects such as the temperature, pH, conductivity, turbidity, and ion concentration of the water. Temperature is relevant because pH and conductivity are temperature dependent and thus higher temperatures typically indicate the presence of biologics. pH is monitored because the safe pH range for drinking water is from 6.5 to 8.0. Conductivity is recorded as an indirect measure of water hardness with calcium, magnesium, and sodium concentrations. Lastly, turbidity is relevant as it is a measure of water cloudiness due to particulates and sediment. The sensors are connected to the data acquisition unit located in the analysis chamber. Water exits the collection chamber through an outflow pipe after all the necessary data is acquired. \nThe device then sends the collected measurements over a 2G network, and a web dashboard application receive the data updates graphs and other visuals immediately. The dashboard provides various graphic and analytical tools to allow users to find meaningful trends in the data. It additionally notifies users through text or email if it detects any dangerous changes in the water quality. The designs and insights from this project were sent to collaborators at Forefront upon completion. ",

Generally, current storage devices at the time of the project only kept vaccines fresh for a maximum of five days because the cooling process only involved an off-the-shelf cooler with multiple ice packs. However, a vaccine that has not been transported at the correct temperature is ineffective. EWH’s vaccine refrigerator gave people more time to transport vaccines between sites without the fear of ruining the vaccines.\n The idea came from Bill Gates’ “Super Thermos” model, which can cool vaccines for 30 to 60 days depending on temperatures and humidity. For EWH’s vaccine refrigerator model, a cylindrical chamber that holds the physical vaccine is surrounded by layers of insulation that prevents heat loss. The cylindrical structure, which opens from the top, minimizes exposure to the outside air when the fridge is opened. \nThe fridge was made of HPMI plastic because the material is durable and has lower thermal conductivity. Aerogel insulation was used for its low conductivity. Members ran multiple tests to examine the reliability and effectiveness of the vaccine refrigerator. For example, temperature retention was tested by inserting temperature probes in various locations of the cooler, such as in the vaccine vials, at the door, and near any light sources. \nSimulations demonstrated that the fridge could hold 138 vaccine doses and maintain a temperature within a 2-8 degree Celsius desired range for 16 hours.",

A few years ago, members of the team traveled to Lima, Peru for eight days where they partnered with MedLife International, a nonprofit organization that runs many mobile clinics. During the trip, the team shadowed health care workers and worked alongside them to serve local patients. They also completed several projects, including building a staircase to help facilitate transportation for the community. Through this eye-opening experience, our members not only grew as individuals through their first-hand exposure to the implementation of global health initiatives, but also helped bring back ideas and stories that guide the future progression of the team. As our team continues to grow, we hope we can continuously build upon these valuable first hand experiences by creating more opportunities to interact with the world.\n Quotes from our alumni: \n “This experience helped shed light on the actual lifestyle of the people we design products for, along with providing an insider perspective on how a developing community lives and the unique region-specific illnesses it faces.“ - Justin \n “The experience of visiting and seeing the low resource environment puts context into the work we do back at Cornell. We can put faces to the people we [were] trying to serve; it gave me extra motivation to work and develop a solution having met these people in need.“ - Paul \n“There [was] beautiful, filtered water running in huge pipes through many poor, water-borne-disease-prone communities surrounding Lima, but it only carries the clean water into the rich areas, not stopping for the poor. It made me realize that engineering has to work in conjunction with people and their governments in order to have any effect. Seeing that blatant inefficiency caused by policies has definitely changed the way I will approach engineering problems in the future.“ -Brecken ",

The World Health Organization estimated that 70% to 96% of medical equipment in these countries is broken, however, many medical facilities do not have the financial capabilities to replace important parts for these existing devices. One such device commonly utilized is a vital signs monitor (VSM), a diagnostic instrument capable of logging a patient’s heart-rate, blood pressure, temperature, and pulse oximetry. \n The Cornell EWH chapter contacted medical professionals abroad regarding the scarcity of affordable VSMs, and gauged the necessity of such an instrument in evolving healthcare systems. It was determined that a more robust, affordable VSM could serve a much needed medical service. Building upon this idea, Cornell EWH began developing an idea that would later evolve into a more complex system of networked VSMs capable of remotely sharing real-time patient information with medical professionals so as to augment timely medical services. \n The final device had the ability to send the collected information through a radio frequency to a central location known as the “base station”, which maintained two databases for patient and nurse information. The base station recorded information such as the nurse’s mobile phone number for SMS messaging to facilitate quicker response times if a patient’s health suddenly deteriorates. Along with receiving an SMS message, the VSM indicated the patient’s worsening condition via buzzers and LEDs. Accompanying SMS messaging, a nurse was able to monitor any patient’s status through a web application accessible from any internet-enabled device.",

The KMC technique refers to swaddling the baby to the mother’s or father’s chest to emphasize skin-to-skin contact.

This remains a heavily recommended technique for newborns, especially in the developing world. \n Unfortunately, the KMC technique was not without its limitations. Improperly swaddling  a child can lead to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) if the child is wrapped too tightly. Furthermore, the swaddling cloth will get dirty over time, leading to heightened infection risks. In response, the team developed the Antimicrobial Baby Holster to minimize the risk of infection in KMC. The baby holster was functionally identical to the swaddling clothes used around the world today, with the added benefit of being antimicrobial. The aloe vera spray coating used to make the cloth antimicrobial was determined to be readily available and could last for a number of wash cycles. By retaining its antimicrobial properties for long periods of time, the holster aims to further reduce infant mortality in line with the Millenium Development Goal.",

            "info_long": "Every year, millions of women world-wide suffer from excessive blood loss in cases of ruptured ectopic pregnancies. For instance, hemorrhaging is the leading cause of maternal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa, with 87% due to ectopic pregnancy ruptures. Women can often lose up to half their blood volume (developing acute anemia) and are usually in desperate need of transfusion. However, in developing nations, there are often insufficient supplies of donor blood due to high frequency of diseases such as HIV/AIDS. \n Design Innovations for Infants and Mothers Everywhere (DIIME) has attempted to address this problem by developing a device, known as the Hemafuse, which transfers and filters blood using a manual hand-pump method, and then re-transfuses the clean blood into patients. Although this device is simple, clean, and reusable, it fails to make the process less labor intensive, nor does it reduce crowding and chaos in the surgical area. \n The Autologous Transfusion System designed by EWH Cornell sought to create a simple handheld, reusable auto-transfusion system that addressed several shortcomings of the current Hemafuse device. The proposed transfusion system would be inserted into the patient’s abdomen during surgery and sucked out by a foot pump powered by a hand crank. The foot pump draws the blood through a sterile IV bag with anticoagulant tubing, and anticoagulant is added  to remove and prevent clots, ensuring safe blood storage before transfusion. This blood transfusion process not only stores blood in a sterile environment with anticoagulants but also returns the blood to a patient in a closed loop system. This system, therefore, reduced the risk of transmitting airborne infections and transfusing clots into the patient's body. Moreover, the transfusion system was designed to be a distance away from the operating table to clear surgical space, so the nurse isn’t clumsily extracting and pumping blood out of wounds while near the physicians who are attempting to operate. The designs were provided for resource limited clinics in sub-Saharan Africa as an option to achieve fewer patient complications, lower procedure costs, and decreased mortality rates related to pregnancy.",
