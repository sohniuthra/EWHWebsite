      question: "What is a project team?",
      answer:
        "Cornell Engineering Student Project Teams mimic real-world engineering by bringing Cornell students, faculty, and staff together to solve complex problems in team-based settings. Project teams provide students with a rich, multidisciplinary experience, working in diverse teams to tackle challenging, real-world problems. Students can earn course credit for their participation in this program.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to be an engineer to join?",
      answer:
        "Definitely not! Many of our members come from non-engineering backgrounds and majors. As fellow students, we are here to learn from each other. This is why we do not require or expect any particular knowledge or experiences during our recruitment. Instead, we look for people who express a passion for our mission, can commit to our organization, and are genuinely interested in learning more.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does the application process look like?",
      answer:
        "Our application process begins with a resume submission and written application through which we hope to gauge your interest in our team and mission. You may apply to multiple subteams (e.g. software, integrative design, electrical, business), but we will ask you to rank your preferences. After the initial screening process, we invite several applicants to subteam-specific interviews. Our recruitment process is designed not only for us to learn more about your awesome interests and stories, but also for applicants to learn more about us!",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the time commitment?",
      answer:
        "The time commitment fluctuates depending on the demands of any given week or semester. On average, our members expect to spend about 9 hours a week on the team. However, as a group of friends and students, we support each other and understand that college isnâ€™t easy. Our best work comes when we can enjoy our work, and we stick to these ideals. Therefore, while we expect a certain level of commitment, we emphasize a culture of flexibility.",
