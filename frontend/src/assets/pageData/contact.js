    "As an entirely student-led project team, EWH requires funding to continue its social mission. The support of sponsors and donors has allowed EWH to tackle global health issues through devices such as our low-cost vaccine refrigerator or vital signs monitor. We are always seeking new corporate partners who can help us in our mission. Thank you for your support, and it would be our pleasure to share our journey with you.",
  collaborator_paragraph:
    "Beyond the sponsors who partner with us, our student project team works with collaborators every semester. These collaborators come from various backgrounds around the world -- these organizations fuel our organization and serve as the cornerstone for our projects. Most importantly, they align with our mission of striving to create meaningful impact through innovative technology solutions that target the worldâ€™s most pressing health issues. We are constantly on the lookout for collaborators who will join us to work together and create projects that will revolutionize the world of health technology.",
