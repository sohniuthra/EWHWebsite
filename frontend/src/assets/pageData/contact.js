    "As an entirely student-led project team, EWH requires funding to continue its social mission. Corporate sponsorships are a way for us to fund our team through a joint effort between leading organizations as well as our student team. As alumni, our former team members often also give back to our team in the form of mentorship or partnership. The support of sponsors and donors has allowed EWH to tackle global health issues through devices such as our low-cost vaccine refrigerator or vital signs monitor. We are always seeking new corporate partners who can help us in our mission. For Fall 2020, some of the main projects we are working on involve a “Health Friend” project with Barefoot College, a Management Sciences for Health Collaboration, and Calmer Project with a Professor at B.C. Children's Hospital. Our past projects (by name) include tVNS, Kijenzi, INDAGO, Incinerator, Rex, and our Grip Sensor project. EWH would not be able to pursue these projects without your generous contributions. We greatly appreciate your help in turning our project ideas into reality and are reminded that we are not alone on our journey of social impact. Thank you for your support, and it would be our pleasure to share our journey with you.",
